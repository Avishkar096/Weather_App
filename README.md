# MeteorMingle â˜”

A new Flutter project.

# Description:

Clima is a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs created by Olia Gozha. With Clima, you can easily find out the live weather data for the current location of your device or any city you can think of! This app was built using Dart and Flutter, and it demonstrates various aspects of asynchronous programming, networking, and data handling.


# Features

- Get live weather data for your current location.
- Search for weather information for any city in the world.
- Detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, and condition.
- Beautiful and intuitive user interface.

# How It Works

Clima is a great example of asynchronous programming in Dart and Flutter. It leverages the following concepts:

- Async and Await: We use asynchronous programming to fetch weather data from the internet and handle time-consuming tasks like getting device location.

- Futures: Futures are used to represent values or errors that will be available at some time in the future. Clima uses futures to manage asynchronous operations effectively.

- Networking with HTTP: The Dart http package is used to make API requests and retrieve weather data.

- API Integration: We interact with a weather API to get real-time weather information for locations.

- JSON Parsing: The Dart convert package helps parse JSON data from API responses.

- Navigation: We use the Navigator to switch between screens and pass data back and forth.

- Exception Handling: Clima showcases how to handle exceptions using try/catch/throw in Dart.

- Stateful Widgets: Understanding the lifecycle of Stateful Widgets is crucial for managing app state, and Clima provides insights into this aspect.

- User Input: The TextField widget is used to take user input for city search.
